I'm a junior student in [Turing class](https://cfcs.pku.edu.cn/research/turing_program/introduction1/index.htm), [School of Computer Science](https://eecs.pku.edu.cn), [Peking University](https://english.pku.edu.cn). 
I'm interested in computer vision for robotics. Currently, I am a research intern at Hyperplane Lab, 
[Center on Frontiers of Computing Studies](https://cfcs.pku.edu.cn/english/), advised by [Prof. Hao Dong](https://zsdonghao.github.io).
I'm also collaborating with [Dr. Kaichun Mo](https://kaichun-mo.github.io) on

Research Experience
======
- **Learning Dense Visual Actionable Affordance for Deformable Object Manipulation**  2021.1 - Present \
  * Hyperplane Lab, Center on Frontiers of Computing Studies, Peking University \
  * Supervisor: Prof. Hao Dong, Ph.D. Ruihai Wu  \
  * We propose to learn dense visual representation for deformable object manipulation
, which reveals the dynamic and kinematic property of deformable objects. 
We also propose a novel training pipeline to take the future states after manipulation into consideration. 
By training in a reversed step-by-step manner, we enable the representation to be aware of 
‘potential’, thus finding the global optimal action for deformable object manipulation tasks. \
  * Paper under review  


- **Confidence-aware Affordance Learning for Object Manipulation**  2022.12 - Present
  * Center on Frontiers of Computing Studies, Peking University \
  * Supervisor: Dr. Kaichun Mo, Prof. Hao Dong \
  * We propose ‘Confidence’ to measure uncertainty in affordance learning, aiming at Solving the data inefficiency 
in learning affordance for manipulating diverse objects. We also enable the model to perform few-shot learning on 
novel objects by sampling interactions in low-confidence area.
