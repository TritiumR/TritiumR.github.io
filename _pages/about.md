# Welcome To My Home Page


I'm a junior student in [Turing class](https://cfcs.pku.edu.cn/research/turing_program/introduction1/index.htm), [School of Computer Science](https://eecs.pku.edu.cn), [Peking University](https://english.pku.edu.cn). 
I'm interested in computer vision for robotics. Currently, I am a research intern at Hyperplane Lab, 
[Center on Frontiers of Computing Studies](https://cfcs.pku.edu.cn/english/), advised by [Prof. Hao Dong](https://zsdonghao.github.io).
I'm also collaborating with [Dr. Kaichun Mo](https://kaichun-mo.github.io) (NVIDIA) on robot manipulation.

You can find my CV here: [Chuanruo Ning's CV](https://tritiumr.github.io/assets/CV.pdf)


Research
======

- **Learning Actionable Affordance for Deformable Object Manipulation**  2022.1 - Present 
  * Hyperplane Lab, Center on Frontiers of Computing Studies, Peking University 
  * Supervisor: [Ph.D. Candidate Ruihai Wu](https://warshallrho.github.io), [Prof. Hao Dong](https://zsdonghao.github.io)
  * We propose to learn dense visual representation for deformable object manipulation
, which reveals the dynamic and kinematic property of deformable objects. 
We also propose a novel training pipeline to take the future states after manipulation into consideration. 
By training in a reversed step-by-step manner, we enable the representation to be aware of 
'potential', thus finding the global optimal action for deformable object manipulation tasks. 
  * Paper under review

- **Confidence-aware Affordance Learning for Object Manipulation**  2022.12 - Present
  * Center on Frontiers of Computing Studies, Peking University 
  * Supervisor: [Dr. Kaichun Mo](https://kaichun-mo.github.io) (NVIDIA), [Prof. Hao Dong](https://zsdonghao.github.io) 
  * We propose 'Confidence' to measure uncertainty in affordance learning, aiming at Solving the data inefficiency 
in learning affordance for manipulating diverse objects. We also enable the model to perform few-shot learning on 
novel objects by sampling interactions in low-confidence area.
