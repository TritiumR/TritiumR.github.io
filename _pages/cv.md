Education
======
* B.S. Turing class, School of Computer Science, Peking University, 2024 (expected)
  GPA: 2022-present: 3.85
      2021-2022: 3.79

Research experience
======
* 2021.1-present:
  * Research Assistant in Hyperplane Lab, Center on Frontiers of Computing Studies, Peking University
  * Project: Deformable Object Manipulation
  * Abstract: Learning dense visual representation for deformable object manipulation, which reveals the dynamic and kinematic property of deformable objects. We also propose a novel training pipeline to take the future states after manipulation into consideration. By training in a reversed step-by-step manner, we enable the representation to be aware of ‘potential’, thus finding the global optimal action.
  * Supervisor: Dr. Ruihai Wu, Prof. Hao Dong

* 2022.12-present:
  * Project: Affordance Learning for Object Manipulation
  * Abstract: Learning dense visual representation for articulated object and manipulation, which reveals the dynamic and kinematic property of deformable objects. We also propose a novel training pipeline to take the future states after manipulation into consideration. By training in a reversed step-by-step manner, we enable the representation to be aware of ‘potential’, thus finding the global optimal action.
  * Supervisor: Professor Hub
