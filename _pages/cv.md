Research experience
======
* 2021-present: Research Assistant
  * Hyperplane Lab, Center on Frontiers of Computing Studies, Peking University
  * Project: Deformable Object Manipulation
  * Abstract: Learning dense visual representation for deformable object manipulation, which reveals the dynamic and kinematic property of deformable objects. We also propose a novel training pipeline to take the future states after manipulation into consideration. By training in a reversed step-by-step manner, we enable the representation to be aware of ‘potential’, thus finding the global optimal action.
