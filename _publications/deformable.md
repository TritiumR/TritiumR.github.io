  * We propose to learn dense visual representation for deformable object manipulation
, which reveals the dynamic and kinematic property of deformable objects. 
We also propose a novel training pipeline to take the future states after manipulation into consideration. 
By training in a reversed step-by-step manner, we enable the representation to be aware of 
'potential', thus finding the global optimal action for deformable object manipulation tasks. 
  * Paper under review
